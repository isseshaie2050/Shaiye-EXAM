    [SectionType.MCQ]: `القسم الأول: الفهم والإستيعاب
الكرم هو صفة محمودة من صفات البشر، وهو الإنفاق وإعطاء المال لمن يحتاج إليه ابتغاء وجه الله الكريم، ويفضل أن يتحلى بها كل إنسان، ولها أهمية كبيرة في المجتمع حيث أنها تساعد على نشر مبدأ الأخوة والرحمة بين الناس، بالإضافة إلى ذلك يعد الكرم من الأشياء التي تؤدي إلى تحبيب الناس بعضهم لبعض، حيث ينتفع الإنسان الكريم بحب الآخرين من حوله، فهو دائم العطاء ويسرع دائماً في مساعدة المحتاج، ولا يبخل عليهم بأي شيء مهما كان قليلاً من إمكانياته.

ينبغي أن يكون المسلم كريماً في قوله وفعله، ولا يقتصر الكرم على المال فقط، وليس يقتصر تأثير الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم على الناس بالكلام فقط، بل كان قدوة في أفعاله، والدليل على ذلك ما فعله الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم عند مجيء رجل من المشركين، فأكرمه الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم وأعطاه طعاماً، وتساعد الرجل إلى قومه داعياً للدخول في الإسلام قائلاً: "أسلموا فإن محمداً يعطي عطاء من لا يخاف الفقر".

وهكذا المواقف تظهر تأثير الكرم، ثم تحول إلى دعوة لينشر الدين الإسلامي في كل مكان يوجد فيه الناس، وكان الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم دائماً مثالاً يحتذى به في الكرم، فقد كان كريماً يعطي الناس، ويحثهم على الخير، وكان من خلقه الكرم.

قال تعالى في سورة البقرة:
(وَمَا أَنفَقْتُم مِّن شَيْءٍ فَهُوَ يُخْلِفُهُ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ الرَّازِقِينَ)

وقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم: "ما نقص مال عبد من صدقة".

وقال صلى الله عليه وسلم: "إن الله كريم يحب الكرم".

الشعوب الصومالية معروفة بالكرم، ومن العادات الطيبة لدى الصوماليين التسابق في سبيل التكافل، سواء كانوا مسافرين أم مقيمين، وهناك عادات أخرى يتميز بها الصوماليون من غيرهم من الأمم منها صرف رسوم المشروبات والوجبات الخفيفة في المناسبات، والتضحية من أجل شخص واحد، وضمان تكلفة السفر لمن قطع الزاد عنه، وتقديم القرى للضيوف والمسافرين، فمشاكل المادة لم تمنع الصوماليين من تمسكهم بهذه العادات.

وهذا النوع من الإيثار يبرز قيمة التضحية، وهو ما يعزز قيم التعاون والتكافل، خاصة بين أبناء الصوماليين في غربتهم، ومساهمتهم الكبيرة في المجتمعات التي يعيشون بها، والوطن لهم جميعاً، ويطيرون.

ومن المهم أن نستمر في إدارة المصائب وتخفيف خسائرها، وذلك لن يتحقق إلا بالكرم والتعاون، وأن نقتدي بآبائنا وأجدادنا من هذه الصفة الطيبة، وأن نواصل غرسها في الأجيال الصاعدة للأمة الصومالية.`
